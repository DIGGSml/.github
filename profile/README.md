# Welcome to the Github site for the DIGGS Project

DIGGS is a Special Project of the American Society of Civil Engineers Geo-Institute. You can obtain more information [here.](https://diggsml.org)

Some repoaitories are configured for Github Pages and serve as resouces. They can also be accesed via their diggsml.org URL's:

https://diggsml.org/docs - Schema documentation and other resources

http://diggsml.org/def - Codelist, Property, and CRS dictionaries

Http://diggsml.org/schemas - Direct access to schema files


The DIGGS project involves development of a GML (XML-based) geospatial standard schema for the transfer of geotechnical and geoenvironmental data within an organization or between multiple organizations.  DIGGS can work with existing software, hardware, databases and data storage facilities to easily transfer and share your data.

Once implemented by your organization, the DIGGS data transfer standard will help meet your needs for information and data asset management.  It is anticipated that DIGGS will save state and federal agencies, and other public and private organizations millions of dollars.  Savings will be realized through a combination of avoided drilling and laboratory testing costs, and efficiencies afforded by the availability of geotechnical data for multiple projects in a standard format.
